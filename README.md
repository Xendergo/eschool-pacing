# eschool pacing
 
Where we live, eschool is being very silly. Everything is due at the end of the marking period, but we can't finish all the work beforehand because days we don't have work counts as an absence, which means you have to pace your work very carefully. This is meant to help with that

Also a nice opportunity for me to learn vue.js

Also, weekends are taken into account but not super precisely
